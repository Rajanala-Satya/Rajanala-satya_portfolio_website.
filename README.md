## About me
Hi, I’m Satya Rajanala, a passionate Software Engineer with a strong background in Python, Java, and full-stack web development. I love building real-world applications that combine clean design, performance, and intelligent data-driven solutions.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Kent State University and have hands-on experience working with large-scale systems in the banking and enterprise domains. My interests include backend architecture, API development, cloud deployment (AWS), and machine learning integration.

I enjoy exploring how technology can solve real business problems — whether it’s automating workflows, modernizing legacy systems, or building web-based AI applications that improve everyday life.

Outside of work, I like experimenting with new frameworks, contributing to open-source projects, and creating small utilities that make development faster and smarter.
